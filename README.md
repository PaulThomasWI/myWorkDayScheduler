# myWorkDayScheduler

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Day.js

I added three buttons from FontAwesome. The first button takes you back a day. The second button moves you forward a day and the third button, which looks like a gear takes you to a configuration page where you can set up your work hours.
